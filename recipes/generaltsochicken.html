    <h2>Description :</h2>
    <p>General Tso’s Chicken is that perfect combination of sweet, savoury, spicy and tangy with crispy Chinese chicken bites.</p>    
    <h2>Ingredients :</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Chicken</li>
        <li>Garlic</li>
        <li>Ginger</li>
        <li>Cornflour/Cornstarch</li>
        <li>Chilli</li>
        <li>Soy sauce</li>
        <li>Rice vinegar</li>
        <li>Brown Sugar</li>
        <li>Hoisin sauce</li>
        <li>Sesame oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps :</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Sauce/Marinade</strong> – first, mix the Sauce/Marinade. We do this in two parts. Firstly, mix all the ingredients except the sugar, chicken stock/broth and the cornflour/cornstarch, and use some of this initial mix to marinate the chicken (in Step 2 below). THEN mix in the sugar, stock and cornflour to the remainder to create the dish’s final Sauce – these are Sauce-specific ingredients we don’t want in the chicken marinade;</li>
        <li><strong>Marinate Chicken</strong> – Use 2 tablespoons of the initial Sauce mix to marinate the chicken for 30 minutes along with fresh garlic and ginger. It’s really nice to add fresh ginger and garlic into the marinade to really get those flavours into the chicken;</li>
        <li><strong>Coat chicken</strong>in cornflour – just add it into the bowl and mix, making sure the pieces are separate so they are fully coated;</li>
        <li><strong>Shake off excess</strong>cornflour using whatever method works for you – I use a colander these days. Not all the cornflour falls through the colander holes and that’s ok. It still gives me a means to shake out most of the excess and some chunks settled at the base. We don’t want a thick layer of cornflour on the chicken because it can make it taste powdery and also you end up with loads of cornflour in the oil which burns unless you scoop it out;</li>
        <li><strong>Cook chicken using preferred amount of oil</strong> – either shallow fry as I do (which is when the chicken is sitting on the base of the pan and the oil comes halfway up the chicken) or deep fry (which is when there is enough oil so the chicken floats around in the oil). You can even cook it with just a thin layer of oil in the pan but you’ll need to rotate each piece of chicken 4 to 6 times to get all sides crispy – which is a pain!</li>
        <li><strong>Drain on paper towels</strong>to remove excess oil.</li>
    </ol>
